THE ROAD AHEAD: WHAT’S NEXT FOR OUR DIGITAL CAMPUS

While we have made great strides, we aren't finished yet. Our developer is currently hard at work building the next phase of our integrated system to provide even more transparency and control for our families.
Here are the major features currently under development:

✨ Upcoming: Finance & Enrollment Synergy
We are working on a seamless bridge between student enrollment details and the school finance system. 
Once launched, this will allow students and parents to digitally track financial records, view payment history, and monitor outstanding balances directly through the portal.

📱 Under Development: Real-Time Academic Access
The developer is building a deep integration between enrollment data and academic records.
This future update will empower students and parents to track grades, attendance, and overall academic performance anytime and anywhere, ensuring you stay connected to educational progress in real-time.

🚀 Expanding Your Journey Tracking
The current Reference Number system is being expanded to cover more than just application status.
Future updates will allow you to track:
• Real-time Financial Clearance & Billing Updates
• Live Academic Assessment Progress
• Instant Access to Digital Grade Slips

✅ Automated Record Synchronization
The developer is refining the backend to ensure that financial and academic data updates automatically the moment an enrollment step is completed.
This will eliminate the need for manual record requests and ensure your data is always perfectly synchronized across all school departments.

🔒 Enhanced Data Protection for Integrated Records
As we integrate more sensitive financial and academic data, we are further strengthening our encryption protocols.
We are ensuring that these upcoming features remain fully compliant with the Data Privacy Act, keeping your family's integrated records secure and private.

We are excited to bring these innovations to you soon. The future of a truly connected student experience is just around the corner!
